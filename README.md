# TokenizedTimeTracking Smart Contract

## Vision
TokenizedTimeTracking is a blockchain-based solution designed to revolutionize how freelancers and employers handle time tracking and payments. The project aims to create a transparent, automated, and trustless system for logging work hours and processing payments in the freelance ecosystem.

The core vision is to eliminate payment disputes, reduce payment delays, and create an immutable record of work hours while automating the payment process through smart contracts. This system brings accountability and efficiency to remote work relationships.

## Features
- **Decentralized Time Logging**: Freelancers can log their hours worked and hourly rates on-chain
- **Automated Payments**: Smart contract automatically calculates and processes payments in ERC-20 tokens
- **Project Ownership**: Clear designation of project owners with permission control
- **Transparent History**: All time logs and payments are recorded on the blockchain
- **Token-based Payments**: Flexible payment system using any ERC-20 token

## Technical Details

### Contract Address
- Mainnet: `[TO BE DEPLOYED]`
- Sepolia Testnet: `[TO BE DEPLOYED]`
- Payment Token: `[SPECIFY TOKEN ADDRESS]`

### Smart Contract Architecture
1. **Main Components**:
   - IERC20 Interface for token payments
   - TimeLog structure for storing work details
   - Mapping for time logs and project ownership
   
2. **Core Functions**:
   - `logTime`: Records worked hours and rate
   - `approveTime`: Processes approval and payment
   - `setProjectOwner`: Assigns project ownership

### Security Features
- Employer verification through modifiers
- Payment validation checks
- Single project owner assignment
- Balance verification before payments

## How It Works
1. Project owner is set for a specific project ID
2. Freelancer logs their time and hourly rate
3. Employer reviews and approves the time log
4. Smart contract automatically calculates and transfers payment
5. All transactions are recorded on-chain for transparency

## Future Scope

### Phase 1: Enhanced Time Management
- Multiple time entries per project
- Time log modification with approval history
- Bulk approval system for multiple entries

### Phase 2: Advanced Payment Features
- Multiple token support
- Payment scheduling
- Milestone-based payments
- Escrow system implementation

### Phase 3: Platform Integration
- Decentralized dispute resolution
- Rating system for both parties
- Integration with popular freelance platforms
- Mobile app development

### Phase 4: Analytics and Reporting
- Work history analytics
- Payment tracking dashboard
- Performance metrics
- Time utilization reports
